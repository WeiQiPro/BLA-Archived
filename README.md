# Baduk-Live-Analysis
This is a solo installation and does not come with katago.
Best way to currently set this up is to edit the entryPoint.json file with paths to Katago files.

Once you download,
edit the file
run npm start

Once electron has loaded, you may add demo board game URLs and send to kataGo.
Once websocket connection is set up, games will start to display.
